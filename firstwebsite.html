    <h1>Covid-19</h1>
    <h2>Coronavirus disease (Covid-19)</h2>
<p>
    Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, 
    but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection
    with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.
</p>
<p>
    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and 
    recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
